# Security Fix Verification Test

## Test Case: Deleted User Should Not Access App

### Current Issue (BEFORE FIX):
- User UID `7EQC6llKX7ZvnLpybaWpZoZdyNy2` was deleted from Firebase
- App still shows user as logged in
- **VULNERABILITY:** Local cache is trusted without backend verification

### Fix Applied:
1. ✅ Changed `AppRoutes.initial` from `welcome` to `splash`
2. ✅ Removed synchronous auth check in `main.dart`
3. ✅ **App now ALWAYS starts with Splash Screen**
4. ✅ Splash Screen calls `verifyCurrentUser()` which:
   - Checks local storage
   - **Verifies with Firebase backend**
   - Cleans up if user deleted
   - Routes appropriately

---

## Expected Behavior (AFTER FIX):

### Scenario: App Restart with Deleted User

```
User opens app
    ↓
Splash Screen appears (SpinningLogoLoader)
    ↓
Check local auth storage
Found user: 7EQC6llKX7ZvnLpybaWpZoZdyNy2
    ↓
Call user.reload() to verify with Firebase
    ↓
Firebase returns: "user-not-found" ❌
    ↓
AuthService.verifyCurrentUser() detects deleted account
    ↓
Automatically signs out locally:
  - Clears Firebase auth cache
  - Removes session token
    ↓
Navigate to Welcome Screen ✅
    ↓
User must create new account
```

---

## Testing Steps:

### 1. Stop the app if running
```bash
# In your terminal, stop the current Flutter session
```

### 2. Hot restart or rebuild
```bash
flutter run
# OR if already running, press 'R' in terminal for hot restart
```

### 3. Expected Console Output:
```
flutter: verifyCurrentUser: Verifying user session for UID: 7EQC6llKX7ZvnLpybaWpZoZdyNy2
flutter: verifyCurrentUser: Firebase auth error - user-not-found
flutter: verifyCurrentUser: User account is invalid, cleaning up session
flutter: Splash: No valid user, navigating to Welcome
```

### 4. Expected Visual Behavior:
- ✅ See Splash Screen with SpinningLogoLoader
- ✅ Brief delay (2 seconds)
- ✅ Navigate to Welcome Screen (NOT Home Screen)
- ✅ "Quick Start" button visible
- ✅ User must authenticate again

---

## Verification Checklist:

After restarting the app:

- [ ] Splash Screen appears first
- [ ] Console shows "verifyCurrentUser" messages
- [ ] Console shows "user-not-found" error
- [ ] Console shows "cleaning up session"
- [ ] App navigates to Welcome Screen
- [ ] No error dialogs appear
- [ ] User can tap "Quick Start" to create new account

---

## What Changed:

### Before (INSECURE):
```dart
// main.dart - OLD CODE
String _getInitialRoute() {
  final User? currentUser = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  
  if (currentUser != null) {
    return AppRoutes.home; // ❌ VULNERABILITY: Only checks local cache
  }
  return AppRoutes.initial;
}
```

### After (SECURE):
```dart
// main.dart - NEW CODE
initialRoute: AppRoutes.initial, // Always start with Splash

// splash_screen.dart
Future<void> _checkAuthStatus() async {
  final authService = serviceLocator.authService;
  
  // ✅ SECURE: Verifies with Firebase backend
  final bool isUserValid = await authService.verifyCurrentUser();
  
  if (isUserValid) {
    Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed(AppRoutes.home);
  } else {
    Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed(AppRoutes.welcome);
  }
}
```

---

## Why This Fixes the Issue:

### Root Cause:
`FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser` is a **synchronous** property that only reads from **local encrypted storage**. It does NOT verify with Firebase servers.

### Solution:
- Always start with Splash Screen
- Splash Screen calls `user.reload()` which is **asynchronous** and **contacts Firebase backend**
- If user deleted, Firebase returns error
- We catch the error and sign out locally
- User is routed to Welcome Screen

### Security Benefits:
1. ✅ **Backend Verification:** Every app launch checks with Firebase
2. ✅ **Auto Cleanup:** Invalid sessions removed automatically
3. ✅ **Consistent Flow:** All users go through verification
4. ✅ **Fail-Safe:** Unknown errors trigger sign-out

---

## Additional Security Notes:

### Session Cleanup:
When we call `await _firebaseAuth.signOut()`, Flutter/Firebase cleans up:
- ✅ Local auth token
- ✅ Cached user data
- ✅ Keychain (iOS) / EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android) entries
- ✅ Any pending Firestore listeners

### Firestore Protection:
Even if someone bypassed client-side checks, Firestore security rules would block them:
```javascript
// Firestore rules prevent access with invalid token
allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId;
```

---

## Test the Fix Now:

1. **Hot Restart the app** (press 'R' in terminal or stop/start)
2. Watch the console output
3. Verify you see Welcome Screen (not Home Screen)
4. Confirm user UID `7EQC6llKX7ZvnLpybaWpZoZdyNy2` cannot access app

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIX APPLIED - READY FOR TESTING**

**Expected Result:** Deleted user `7EQC6llKX7ZvnLpybaWpZoZdyNy2` will be signed out automatically and must create a new account.
