# Background Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the backgrounds for the Profile, Game, and Leaderboard screens with a new animated background system that provides a more attractive and engaging visual experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Animated Background Widget
**File**: `lib/widgets/animated_background.dart`

Created a sophisticated animated background featuring:
- **Multi-layered gradient**: Uses 4 colors blending from top-left to bottom-right
  - Deep navy (`#0A192F`) 
  - Deep purple tint (`#1A0B2E`)
  - Navy blue (`#0D1B2A`)
  - Navy blue tint (`#16213E`)

- **Radial gradient overlays** for depth:
  - Cyan glow in top-left (15% opacity)
  - Magenta glow in bottom-right (12% opacity)
  - Gold accent in center (8% opacity)

- **Animated floating particles** (15 particles):
  - Colors: Cyan, Magenta, Gold, Magenta Variant
  - Smooth, continuous motion with varying speeds
  - Blur effects for soft, dreamy appearance
  - 20-second animation loop

### 2. Updated Screens

#### Profile Screen (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`)
- Replaced `BackgroundGradient` with `AnimatedBackground`
- Enhanced visual appeal with floating particles and color accents

#### Game Screen (`lib/screens/game_screen.dart`)
- Wrapped in `AnimatedBackground` widget
- Adds depth and visual interest to the main game menu

#### Leaderboard Screen (`lib/screens/leaderboard_screen.dart`)
- Replaced `BackgroundGradient` with `AnimatedBackground`
- Makes the leaderboard more engaging and premium-feeling

## Color Scheme Compatibility

All enhancements use the game's core color palette:
- **Primary Cyan** (`#00FFFF`) - Tech/futuristic accent
- **Secondary Magenta** (`#FF00FF`) - Vibrant contrast
- **Tertiary Gold** (`#FFD700`) - Premium/achievement accent
- **Magenta Variant** (`#D946EF`) - Additional variety

Opacity levels are carefully tuned to:
- Maintain readability of UI elements
- Create visual depth without overwhelming
- Stay true to the glassmorphism aesthetic

## Performance Considerations

- Uses Flutter's `CustomPainter` for efficient rendering
- Single `AnimationController` for all particles
- Lightweight particle system (15 particles max)
- Option to disable particles via `showParticles` parameter if needed

## Visual Benefits

1. **More Dynamic**: Constant subtle motion creates life and energy
2. **Better Depth**: Multiple gradient layers create dimensional feeling
3. **Brand Consistent**: Uses exact color palette from app theme
4. **Premium Feel**: Sophisticated animations convey quality
5. **Engaging**: Eye-catching without being distracting

## Usage

The background is automatically applied to:
- Profile Screen
- Game Screen  
- Leaderboard Screen

No additional configuration needed. The animation starts automatically and loops infinitely.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:
- User preference to toggle particle animation
- Different particle counts for different screens
- Particle interaction on touch/tap
- Seasonal color themes
- Performance mode for lower-end devices
